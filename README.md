A Python 3 script to monitor for `Popular Downloads` on YTS and send notifications via Slack.

Script uses web scrapping methodology to check for popular downloads.

## Dependencies

Scripts require following modules to function.

1. requests
2. bs4
3. python-decouple

## Execution

There are three ways to run this script.

1. Run directly on host
2. Run in a docker container
3. Run using tasker

### Run directly on host

Install all dependencies using following command.

```python
python3 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Rename file `.env.example` to `.env` (under `src`).

Populate enviroment variables memntioned in `.env`

Navigate to `src` and execute the script as follow.

```python
python3 yts_bot.py
```

#### OR

Schedule the script execution using cron. Edit crontab file using command `crontab -e` and add following line at the end of the file.

```
0 */12 * * * python3 <path_to_src>/src/yts_bot.py
```

This runs the script every 12 hours.

Historical popular downloads are stored in file `yts_movie_list.txt` to avoid duplicate notifications.
(Do not edit this file manually)

To periodically check for popular downloads, schedule the script using cron.
